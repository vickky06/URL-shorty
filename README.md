# URL-shorty
Overview
• URL shorty is a service that allows people to shorten the URL provided and allows any admin user to have access to visual chart representation of URLs shortened in between the provided time window.
• This application is not, by any stretch of the imagination, complete. All of the features will need to be revised several times before it is finalized. The graphics and layout of the screens is designed but needs to be created for the underlying functionality. The actual look and feel will be developed over time will increase with the input of graphics designers and iterative user feedback.
This spec does not discuss the algorithms used by the time calculation engine, which will be discussed elsewhere. It simply discusses what the user sees when they interact with URL Shorty.
